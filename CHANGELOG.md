### General

- Set up a basic JS project
- Added welcome blurb and footer links
- Built vue apps for each area of the site (Header, Main, Footer)
- Built FontAwesomeIcon Vue component, used to consume @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons icon objects and construct svgs from them.
- Added `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`
- Changed the main access file to see if it will remove the jekyll theming ( I want the whole document dangit >:( )
- More shuffling around of files to attempt to override the default github pages layout
- Added .nojekyll [found here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#static-site-generators:~:text=empty%20file%20called-,.nojekyll,-in%20the%20root)
- Added index.html to the root

- Updated title and favicon
- Testing custom git publishing alias
- Tidy up the DarkMode toggle and add some visual flair
- Added router for a fully fledged SPA
